<h1>Welcome to My Research Hub</h1>
<p>I am Sandra Marion Kam Tsemo, a PhD Candidate at the <a href="https://www.leibniz-zmt.de/" target="_blank">Leibniz Centre for Tropical Marine Research (ZMT)</a> in Bremen, Germany. I specialize in mathematical modelling of marine ecosystems, with a focus on nitrogen fixation, ecological dynamics, and sustainable resource management.</p>

<h2>Current Research</h2>
<p>As a PhD Candidate, I leverage mathematical and computational tools to simulate complex ecological processes. My work provides valuable insights into ecosystem dynamics, predicts future trends under climate change scenarios, and informs decision-making for sustainable resource management.</p>
<p>My current research focuses on <strong>Nitrogen Fixation</strong>. I develop cell-based models incorporating diazotrophs of different size classes (e.g., Trichodesmium and UCYN-A). These models explore how cell size regulates nutrient and carbon uptake dynamics, offering insights into competitive interactions and niche separation in the vertical water column. This study contributes to understanding potential shifts in N₂-fixing communities’ biogeography, with implications for future N₂ fixation rates and marine ecosystem productivity.</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I hold an MSc in Mathematical Sciences from the <a href="https://aims-senegal.org/" target="_blank">African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS)</a> in Mbour, Senegal, and a BSc in Mathematics from the University of Yaounde I, Cameroon. My academic journey has equipped me with expertise in mathematical modelling, computational mathematics, and data analysis, which I apply to address challenges in marine ecology and biodiversity.</p>
